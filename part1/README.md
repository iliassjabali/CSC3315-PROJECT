# Introduction
In this first part of the project, you will design a machine language similar to the one we studied in Unit 3 and implement its interpreter in C. Yes, it sounds a bit strange, a lower-level language interpreted to run on a virtual machine (VM) written in a higher-level language (HLPL), but why not? The point is for you to have the experience of designing a language and writing a simple interpreter for it. Then you will write a more sophisticated translator from a higher-level language to this VM. 
In addition to designing the numeric ML, you will also design a symbolic version of it, like an assembly language (AL). You will use the symbolic version as an intermediate step in the translation from the higher-level to the lower-level numeric language. It will be useful for you to examine and debug the code generated in translating from the higher-level language to code that runs on the VM.
